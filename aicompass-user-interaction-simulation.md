## Phase 1: Expert Onboarding

### Initial Setup (aicompass.vercel.app)

Paul signs up on AI Compass and selects "Expert" role. He's redirected to the AI-driven onboarding.

**AI**: "Hello! I'm here to understand your expertise and create your AI-powered profile. Could you start by telling me about your background and current work?"

**Paul**: "I'm Paul Thompson, CEO of 3advance. We're a web development agency that specializes in building AI-driven solutions. We've been in business for 8 years, focusing primarily on government and enterprise clients. Recently, we've been integrating AI into all our solutions to make them more efficient and user-friendly."

**AI**: "Thank you, Paul. Your focus on AI integration is interesting. Could you tell me about a recent project where you successfully implemented AI to solve a specific challenge?"

**Paul**: "Sure. We recently worked with the Department of Education to build a platform that handles student loan inquiries. We implemented an AI system that automatically categorizes and routes inquiries, while also providing immediate responses to common questions. This reduced response time by 70% and improved satisfaction rates significantly."

**AI**: "That's impressive! Let's dive deeper into your AI implementation approach. How do you typically evaluate whether a client's process could benefit from AI integration?"

**Paul**: "We start with a process audit where we identify repetitive tasks and data bottlenecks. Then we look for patterns that AI could help optimize. For government clients specifically, we focus on maintaining security and compliance while improving efficiency."

[Conversation continues with AI asking detailed questions about:]
- Technical capabilities
- Project methodology
- Team structure
- Ideal client profile
- Pricing range
- Success metrics

## Phase 2: Seeker Interaction

Jon visits 3advance.com/contact and encounters the embedded AI Compass form.

**AI**: "Hello! I'm Paul's AI assistant at 3advance. I help connect potential clients with our team. Could you tell me about your organization and what brings you here today?"

**Jon**: "Hi, I'm Jon Martinez, CEO of GetCivic. We're building a platform for senate offices to better manage constituent communications. Currently, offices are overwhelmed with emails, calls, and letters. We need help implementing AI to streamline this process."

**AI**: "Thanks for sharing, Jon. This aligns well with Paul's expertise, particularly given 3advance's experience with the Department of Education's communication system. Could you tell me more about your current process and the volume of communications you're handling?"

**Jon**: "We work with 10 senate offices, each receiving about 5,000 communications daily. Currently, staff manually categorize and respond to these, leading to significant delays and inconsistencies. We're looking to automate this while maintaining the personal touch senators want to maintain with constituents."

**AI**: "I understand. Based on your needs and Paul's expertise, I can outline a potential approach. First, let me ask: What's your timeline for implementation, and do you have a budget range in mind?"

**Jon**: "We're looking to implement within 3-4 months. Budget is around $300k for the initial phase."

**AI**: "Perfect. Based on our conversation, I've prepared an initial action plan:"

```markdown

**AI**: "Would you like to schedule a call with Paul to discuss this in detail? He has availability this week."

**Jon**: "Yes, that would be great."

**AI**: "Excellent! Please enter your email, and I'll send you a calendar link. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you'd like Paul to prepare for the meeting?"
